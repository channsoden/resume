I am seeking a position as a data scientist, genomicist, or bioinformatician with a company or institute that is making a meaningful impact on people's lives. While my background and broadest area of knowledge is in genomics and the life sciences, I am also eager to apply the statistical and computational methods learned through genomics to novel and significant problems in the world.

Having earned my PhD developing and employing genomic tools to understand evolution, I am equipped with a strong statistical background, intimate knowledge of genomic and Next Generation Sequencing methods, and proficiency with Python and Linux systems, including HPC. I am expert at exploring and visualizing data to find meaningful connections, and as an educator and speaker I have learned to communicate this meaning clearly and concisely. I am proud of my ability to create efficient work, both in data analysis pipelines and in communicating ideas.

While my publications demonstrate my scientific expertise, my GitHub demonstrates my technical abilities in data analysis, communication, and IT. Of particular note are:

- [BRAG](https://github.com/channsoden/BRAG): A computational tool I developed to analyze genomic rearrangements.  
- [The UCB Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/channsoden/PythonBootcamp): A one week course on Python for Bioinformatics which I co-taught for several years, each section of which was revised or written by me at one point.  
- [Dancify](https://github.com/channsoden/dancify/tree/master/dancify): A web app to visualize and tag your Spotify music that I have been developing since graduating.

At my ideal position I would work with a team of data scientists/bioinformaticians, as well as interfacing with other specialists, to iteratively build and improve systems. I would either be developing a visualization tool, or regularly communicating my findings to relevant units in the organization. My projects would be goal-oriented, rather than method- or data-oriented, designed to answer specific, achievable questions.

My ideal employer would foster an inclusive workplace culture with a diverse team by implementing evidence-based policies that reduce bias and toxic behaviors, and would promote a healthy work-life balance by providing benefits, services, and amenities that improve itâ€™s employees quality of life. My ideal employer would be located in or around Oakland, and I am not interested in employment outside the Bay Area.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you, and to building a better world together.

Sincerely,
Christopher Hann-Soden
