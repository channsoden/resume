I earned my PhD for developing statistical and machine learning algorithms to compare genomes. Since then I provide computational consulting for researchers in myriad domains.

Prospective employers or recruiters should also [read my cover letter](https://github.com/channsoden/resume/blob/master/cover_letter.md).
